## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Project management

### What I learned

Since this is my first React project, I've learned a lot about its essentials, file and folder structure, functional components and their reusability etc. It was also my first time using TailwindCSS, so I've learned a lot about it, and I can say I will use it again.
